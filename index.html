                    My name is <b>Jake Dallman</b>. I am a <b>junior</b> at <b>Brebeuf Jesuit Prepatory High School</b> in Indianapolis, Indiana. I love STEM, especially computer science. When I was younger, I wanted to become a lawyer, but my gradual exposure to non-humanities subjects through classes made me realize that I desired to do something that relied heavily on science and math. I had some experience with coding, so I decided to give it a try. Immediately, I realized that, not only was I good at computer science, I actually enjoyed it. To me, the <b>logic of computer science is the epitome of STEM</b>, so I've found that for which I was looking.
